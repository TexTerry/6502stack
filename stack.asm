; The purpose of this code is the implementation of basic stack manipulation
; functions in 6502-assembler, as a basis for a HP-like rpn-calculator project.
; 
; As with most retro computing projects, this calculator will hardly newer 
; exist, but I'll start nevertheless and hopefully will have much fun with
; it :-)
;
; My target-platform is the py65-environment, a featureful 6502-emulator, ;
; written in python. But my goal is to capsule every platform-dependent
; functionality in replaceable code. So it will be easy to port the programm to
; other 6502-platforms.  
;
; In the following descriptions '_X' referse to the topmost element of the 
; stack, following the HP-Calculator-terminology. Don't confuse it with the
; 6502-x-register.

;  8-bit-integer-stack:     $1000 - $10ff
;  Future stacks:           $1100 - $1fff
;  Stackpointer (_X):       $ce/cf
