6502-Stack
==========

The purpose of this project is the implementation of basic stack manipulation
functions and stack arithmetics in 6502-assembler, as a basis for a HP-like
rpn-calculator project.
 
As with most retro computing projects, this calculator will probably newer 
exist, but I'll start nevertheless. :-) 

My target-platform is the py65-environment, a featureful 6502-emulator, 
written in python. But my goal is to capsule every platform-dependent
functionality in replaceable code. So it will be easy to port the programm to
other 6502-platforms.
